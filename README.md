# Rust Tree

This is a simple project to help me learn Rust. It's a program that will create a tree of the path you give it.

This project is based on my repo [Rust Tree](https://github.com/Hokanosekai/rust-tree).

## Usage

```bash
cargo run
```

## Config

You can add files in the `paths.txt` file. don't for get to add a line for each directory you want to add.

```text
src/
src/main.rs
src/tar/
src/tar/zip.rs
src/tar/mod.rs
src/lib.rs
./vscode/
./vscode/settings.json
Cargo.toml
./Cargo.lock
```
